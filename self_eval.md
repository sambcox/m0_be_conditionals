It makes a ton of sense, and it is a great building block for learning more.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

Probably 30-45 minutes, which was what I expected. My goal is to be able to do things like this more quickly

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

The best practice is to keep writing! Experience is the way to learn. I will do that by continuing to explore things that interest me and new commands that I want to know about.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I currently do not have questions, but I'm sure they will come up! When they do, I have plenty of resources to help.
